# MIST 353 Assignment 2: Prototype Development and Research for Web Application
**Due Date**: Febuary 6th, 2024

## Competitive Analysis
-While researching websites that have interactive sea level maps, I found a very interesting map created by NOAA. The map has a lot of user interactivity, such as a sliding sea level bar that lowers and raises the height of the seas. The website also features multiple interactive buttons that show areas of risk, marsh migrations, and flooding caused by high tides. Upon inspecting the website, I noticed the code was organized with blocks of comments, and featured many `(div)`’s that also organized the code. The URL for the website also featured a `#` which ported me to the different pages featured on the websites, just by clicking the buttons on the side.

-Additional research led to the discovery of the weather radar map on the site “weather.com”. The site features an interactive and animated map that shows the past, present, and future forecasts for the weather. Multiple buttons also change between the pages of the map taking you to different sections of the website. When I inspected the website I could see that it features `(class)` and `(id)` code which are implemented into my code as well. I would like to emulate the radar feature of this website to accurately return impactful weather data. [Weather.com Interactive Radar Map](https://weather.com/)

-Another website I found to be useful was the AccuWeather website as it allowed me to gain another perspective into an interactive web design. I enjoyed the air quality map on the website as well as the “Health & Activities” page because it was easier to navigate compared to the “weather.com” website. Inspecting the AccuWeather website gave me insight into how the website was structured and it was similarly structured to the other websites with the utilization of containers and classes.

## GitHub Repository Research

-Looking at this GitHub repository showed me a simple weather app that aligns with the example I was trying to create. It hosts a search bar for your location, a weather forecast for your geolocation, and it shows the temperature and humidity. The index for the repository featured many of the same snippets of code we have done in class such as `(div)`, `(h1)`, `(class)`, `(input)`, etc. The README was very short, lacked in-depth explanations of how their program worked and did not provide any sources. The photo, however, in the README helped show their program and the features it contained. [GitHub - b0oml/WeatherApp](https://github.com/b0oml/WeatherApp/blob/master/README.md)

-This GitHub repository provided helpful examples for the future by showing me the code that would allow me to locate a user based on what they put in the search bar. It is a basic weather app that shows the humidity, air pressure, temperature, and future forecast. This repository’s README is helpful as it shows multiple pictures of what the app is capable of as well as explaining what the app can accomplish. Furthermore, the app creator displays their future plans for the app in the README. [GitHub - Banana021s/Weather-Center](https://github.com/Banana021s/Weather-Center/blob/master/README.md)

## Project Overview
-My porject currently is in its prototype form. It is an app that will use weather data to display future estimates for weather and climate forecasts for people wanting to visaulize the changing enviroment due to global warming.

## Page Descriptions
-The concept for the homepage is a webpage that asks the user for their location and chosen date, then gives the user future weather forecasts and climate data for their geoloaction.

-The concept for the search results page is currently an interactive map that you will be able to place filters on to look at other weather/climate related data.

-At the moment both of these concepts are in production so both are lacking in technical aspects.

## Research Summary
### NOAA Sea Level Map
- Discovered an interactive sea level map by NOAA with features like a sliding sea level bar and buttons indicating areas of risk, marsh migrations, and flooding.
- Noticed well-organized code with comments and `(div)` elements. The URL structure includes a `#` for navigating different pages.

### Weather.com Interactive Radar Map
- Discovered an animated weather radar map on weather.com with past, present, and future forecasts.
- Identified the use of `(class)` and `(id)` code for implementation. Expresses a desire to replicate the radar feature for accurate weather data.

### GitHub - b0oml/WeatherApp
- Examined a GitHub repository showcasing a simple weather app with a location search bar, weather forecast, and temperature/humidity display.
- Observed common code elements like `(div)`, `(h1)`, `(class)`, and `(input)`. Criticized the README for its brevity and lack of in-depth explanations.

### GitHub - Banana021s/Weather-Center
- Explored another GitHub repository featuring a basic weather app displaying humidity, air pressure, temperature, and future forecasts.
- Appreciated the README for its inclusion of multiple pictures illustrating the app's capabilities and detailed explanations, including the developer's future plans.

### Additional Resources
- Used the W3schools HTML Input Types webpage to learn how to implement a search bar into the website.
  [W3schools HTML Input Types](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp)

- Used Bootswatch’s Solar default button to add the search button and used the solar theme for the website as well.

- Used the W3schools HTML DIV example to learn how to create containers and make my website more organized.
  [W3schools HTML DIV Example](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_div.asp)

- Used W3schools HTML CSS examples to edit the colors of my text with Inline CSS. Another thing I used was the CSS font-family and font-size properties off the same webpage.

- Used HTML Javascript to create a button that displayed the date and time.
  [W3schools HTML JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_scripts.asp)

- Used (altacademy.com) to learn how to center a header in HTML.

  ## Future Enhancements 
  - The future of this application largely depends on the upkeep and development of the location gathering capabilities, the development of an interactrive map, and the development of a cleaner looking website.

  ## AI Prompts
  - I had ChatGPT help me put my writings from my google doc into markdown, only for the research summary and the competitive analysis.

  ## Reflection on Resources
  - Originally I had a very hard time locating the sources I would need to create this project, but after watching the proffesors explanation of the homework on YouTube I had a much easier time with the project. The explanation really helped me understand exactly what the project was asking of me and where to find the information if I encountered a challenge. Overall, I used W3schools the most along with the YouTube video, and only used ChatGPT for the formating the README with the data I already held.
